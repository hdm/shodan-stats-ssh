# Shodan Stats (SSH)

This repository includes single-day snapshot stats of SSH detection across the internet, sourced from (Shodan)[https://shodan.io].

The daily snapshots represent only a small portion of the results observed through the web interface.

In the case of SSH, the daily samples cover just over a million services, as opposed to the ~16+ million services aggregated over time on the Shodan website.

IP blocks are truncated at `/16` for IPv4 and `/48` for IPv6.
